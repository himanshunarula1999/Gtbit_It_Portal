Review
"People are smart and friendly"
"People are not that busy, so they are nice to help our. They did make a suitable intern project that you can finish it in time and learn something."
"Great working environment. Good work life balance"
"Management confusion at times with vision for the company."
"work culture, benefits, growth, people,"
"Great products. Vision you can feel good about. Fair compensation. Automonomy in your role. Wide array of industries / roles employees are able to explore. Feedback loops give employees that ability to provide feedback to management regularly on their performance. Expectation that you will go above and beyond the minimum scope of your role - those that do, are typically rewarded. What more do you want from an employer."
"Impact driven. Best tech in the world."
"good work life balance."
"bad working environment."
"Job was completely based on contract basis. There are very less chances for gaining technical skill if you work in customer service department but you still can gain a lot of skills if you work in technical departments. Very strict working hours. During my tenure at Amazon due to pandemic I had to work from home so there are not many things I didn't like about working here."
"Good work environment and culture. Teammates are supportive and the management is transparent. There is a huge cafeteria and gaming arcade for chilling. Company policies are good, appraisals are fair and they give good salary hike and bonus every year"
There is a lot of politics and the management doesnâ€™t address our issues. Salary is decent but career growth is slow. There is a bond of 2 years before which you cannot resign. On the job training is not given to new joinees
"Ambitious mission, great colleagues, supportive atmosphere."
"Good opportunities for different technical experiences, good work-life balance, good compensation, great coworkers"
"Great pay, good food, fun employees"
"Great place to work, learn new things, grow and innovate. Able to maintain a respectful and healthy workplace culture despite the recent press."

"Great place to work, free food, and great culture."
"Flexible timings, surrounded by technical experts and platform to grow and new ideas"
